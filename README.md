# Simple Plasma Layout Changer [SPLC]
SPLC was originally called Peux Plasma Layout Changer and is actively used in Peux OS KDE since version 21.03. The layout changer is very simple and its GUI is designed using FIGMA.

## How it works?
Each layout is identified using the layout image. All you have to do is to click on any specific image, and the backend script will trigger the changes automatically. The backend scripts are simple "bash" scripts and very easy to understand.

## How to install?
Copy and paste the below code in your favorite terminal:

```
 git clone https://github.com/DN-debug/peux_os_splc.git splc
 cd splc
 sudo ./install.sh
```

The installation script will install latte-dock, move the necessary files and make the scripts executable. It is a simple-and-pretty-easy-to-understand script.

## Where to go from here?
Since the beginning of its release, this has always been marked as "Experimental". To be honest, this is not experimental from functionality perspective, because it does what it is meant for. Rather, it is experimental from user-interface perspective. 

The action plan is to make its user-interface a bit more attractive. I have yet to think on that part.

## Contribution
If anyone would like to contribute to make it better, lets say from user-interface perspective, then that'd be most welcomed, so feel free to drop in suggestions, queries, PRs.

Personal use or use in your own project as you want, but please make sure to give credit links to this repo.
